This repository is going to work as a reservoir of analysis results obtained from combolists.

## Comment

I assume that combolists are formatted like `<email><delimiter><password or hash>`, although some combolists apparently have `<password or hash><delimiter><email>` or `<email>` or some sort of garbage (at least for me without any profound knowledge...).

Note that analysis results may not be accurate because of my humble processing.
